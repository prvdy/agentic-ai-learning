# Agentic AI Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my progressive learning in **agentic AI systems** through
concept notes, small experiments, and project case studies.

The focus is on understanding:
- what makes a system agentic
- decision-making loops
- planning vs reactive behavior
- tool use and failure modes

This is a learning-first portfolio. Projects emphasize clarity of reasoning over production polish.

## Structure

- `concepts/` — explanations of core agentic AI ideas in my own words
- `projects/` — deeper case studies applying those ideas
- `reflections/` — weekly learning summaries and takeaways

## Current Focus
- Agent goals, state, and actions
- Decision loops and stopping conditions
- Constraint-aware behavior
- Tool invocation trade-offs
