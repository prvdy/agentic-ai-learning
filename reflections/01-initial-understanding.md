# Initial Reflection

This week focused on understanding what actually makes a system agentic.

## What Clicked
Agents are about control flow and decisions, not prompt complexity.

## What Was Confusing
Knowing when an agent should stop acting is harder than expected.

## Next Exploration
Building a real-time agent that must re-plan when constraints change.
