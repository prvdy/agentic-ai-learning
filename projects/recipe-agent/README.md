# Recipe Agent — Case Study

This project explores how an agent can generate recipes while adapting to constraints
such as dietary preferences, missing ingredients, and substitutions.

The goal of this case study is to explain **how the agent thinks**, not just what it outputs.

**Repository:** https://github.com/prvdy/agent-recipe-generator

## Why This Is Agentic
- The agent decides when to ask clarifying questions
- The agent chooses which tool to use (generation vs substitution)
- The agent adapts its plan based on constraints

This is a learning-focused system, not a production-ready application.
