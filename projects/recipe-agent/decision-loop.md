# Decision Loop

The agent follows a simple decision loop:

- If critical information is missing → ask a question
- If constraints are satisfied → generate recipe
- If ingredients are missing → invoke substitution tool
- Re-evaluate after every action

## Key Learning
Deciding *not* to act is just as important as deciding to act.
